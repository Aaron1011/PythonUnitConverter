The goal of this project is to create an easy-to-use unit converter program written in Python. Currently, only conversions of English and Metric lengths are availabl. I am working on adding the cpability to convert between English and Metric units.

To run the program, simply execute the file 'start.py' with Python and follow the prompts.
