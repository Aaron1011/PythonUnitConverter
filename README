The goal of this project is to create an easy-to-use unit converter program written in Python. Currently, only conversions of English lengths are available (i.e., conversion between inches, feet, yards, and miles). Soon, I will add conversion functions for conversion within metric units of length, and between metric and English units of length.

To run the program, simply execute the file 'start.py' eith Python and follow the prompts.
